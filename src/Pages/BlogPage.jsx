            For many years, the primary debate in the user interface (UI) and
            user experience (UX) design world was "Figma or Adobe XD?" Both were
            powerful, capable tools that allowed designers to create beautiful,
            high-fidelity mockups and prototypes. This competition was healthy,
            as each platform pushed the other to innovate, adding new features
            to win over a rapidly growing community of product designers.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, that intense rivalry has now come to a clear conclusion.
            Adobe has officially announced that it is no longer investing in new
            features for Adobe XD, placing the software in "maintenance mode."
            This decision has effectively ended the competition, cementing Figma
            as the undisputed, industry-standard tool for UI/UX design. The
            question for design teams is no longer which to choose, but rather
            when to migrate fully to Figma.
          </p>

          <p>
            The single biggest reason for Figma's success is its foundation in
            real-time collaboration. Figma was built from the ground up to be a
            "multiplayer" tool in the browser. This means designers, developers,
            product managers, and clients can all be in the same file at the
            same time, leaving comments, making edits, and handing off assets
            seamlessly. This web-first approach eliminated the need for
            "saving," "syncing," or emailing files, solving the
            "v3_final_final.sketch" problem that plagued design teams for years.
          </p>

          <p>
            While collaboration was its "killer feature," Figma also built a
            more robust and flexible design ecosystem. Its community plugins and
            files are a massive advantage, offering solutions for everything
            from accessibility checking to creating complex animations.
            Furthermore, core features like Auto-Layout (for creating responsive
            components) and Variables (for managing design tokens like colors
            and spacing) are widely considered more powerful and more aligned
            with how developers actually build websites and apps.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be fair, Adobe XD had its own distinct advantages, with its
            primary strength being its seamless integration with the Adobe
            Creative Cloud. For designers who lived inside Photoshop and
            Illustrator, XD offered a convenient workflow, allowing them to
            easily move assets between programs. Its prototyping tools were also
            praised for their simplicity and ease of use, particularly for
            creating quick, shareable animations and transitions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, the market has spoken. The need for true, effortless
            collaboration in an increasingly remote world outweighed the
            benefits of a walled-garden ecosystem. Figma's victory signals a
            major shift in the software world, proving that browser-based tools
            can be more powerful and efficient than their traditional desktop
            counterparts. For designers entering the field or teams looking to
            stay current, proficiency in Figma is no longer just a preferenceâ€”it
            is the new professional standard.
